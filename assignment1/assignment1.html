                Nalanda university, established in the 5th century CE in the Indian State of Bihar, was one of the world's first residential 
                universities and a renowned center for learning in ancient India. It attracted scholars and students from all across Asia, offering
                a diverse curriculum that included subjects like theology, grammar, logic, astronomy, metaphysics, and medicine. The university's
                expansive library, known as Dharma Gunj, housed thousands of manuscripts and texts, contributing to its reputation as a pivotal 
                intitution for Buddhist studies and other disciplines. Despite its destruction in the 12th century, Nalanda's legacy as a symbol
                of ancient academic excellence endures.
